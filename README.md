# extreme_values
Approximation of excesses of some probability distributions lying in the domain of attraction of GEV distributions, i.e. Fr√©chet, Burr, Log-Gamma, with (1) GPD and (2) Fischer probability distributions.
Comparison of Bayesian and non-Bayesian inference of quantiles of those distributions with the quantiles of true underlying distribution.

To run simulations:
(1) jupyter http://jupyter.org/install
(2) packages: pystan (e.g. from jupyter with command << !pip install pystan >> )#

Content:
Files titled << non-Bayes >> contain non-Bayesian methods compared among themselves
